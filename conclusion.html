    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        One limitation to our results is that the data we are using is all collected from 
        Montesinho park in Portugal, which has a mediterranean climate. We cannot safely 
        generalize our results to the rest of the world because different parts of the world have 
        different climates.
