        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            With this project, we were able to find answers to our hypotheses to help determine the 
            locality of the next wildfire. First, it was discovered that a positive relationship between
            DC and Temp cannot be determined with this specific data set. Next, the group found a negative 
            linear relationship between humidity levels and temperature.We also noticed a positive 
            exponential relationship between the initial spread index and the fine fuel moisture code.
            Lastly, when checking if location alone was a factor of wildfire occurrence, it appeared 
            that the line of the park has the least frequency of wildfire but the largest burned area. 
            Through the regression analysis, we wanted to see if we could predict the area of a forest 
            fire from temperature alone. As a result, we found that we could use a linear regression
            model to predict the area of a forest fire from temperature since there was a relationship, 
            but it may not be the best prediction model. Because many observations had an area of 0, 
            the next steps may include creating a Logistic Regression model to predict if a 
            forest fire occurs rather than the area of a fire.  
            In all, this data can help protect the forest by making people aware of the 
            contributors of a forest fire and when to be most alert. Park managers should look 
            closely at the highest fire rate area to have sufficient fire control resources at those 
            times. Also, the proposed model is useful for improving firefighting resource management.

        <h1>Limitations</h1>
        <p>
            While the data collected did serve useful in analyzing the factors contributing to a 
            wildfire, a strong prediction of where the next one may occur requires more information. 
            In the future, it would be beneficial to collect data based on the type of vegetation in 
            the area of past wildfires and firefighting intervention, which would provide more context 
            behind the time elapsed to respond to a fire and the strategy used to fight it. Additionally, 
            outlier detection techniques were not used when collecting the data in this data and need 
            to be addressed because forest fires are rare occurrences. Another limitation of our 
            results is that the data we are using is all collected from Montesinho park in Portugal, 
            which has a Mediterranean climate. We cannot safely generalize them to the rest of the world 
            because different parts have different climates.
